## Reproducing Results
To replicate results of this study, first step will downloading the original dataset from the website of International Monetary Fund(IMF) in github, surfce_temp.csv.
After donwloading the original dataset, next step will be running a regression to analyze the data. Cleaned dataset, surface_temp_final.csv, can also be used for recreatring the graphs and EDA analysis we performed in this project.
